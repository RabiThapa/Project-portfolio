    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about">
        
        <p>Welcome to my e-portfolio! My name is Rabi and on this page  I'll tell you a little about myself. I grew up in Baglung District and moved to Kathmandu about 
            2 years ago to attend undergraduate programme. I still miss my hometown and have grown to love this area. I'm currently a stuent at 
            The British College taking classes in the BSc Computing program. During my journey at TBC I've developed a strong interest in the learning
            process and how technology  can be used to facilitate and enrich learning.
