        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web 
            and it is a client-server protocol, which meansrequests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.</p>

        <h3>Basic Features of Https</h3>
        <ul type="square">
           
            <li>HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made,
                the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client
                disconnect the connection
            </li>
            
            <li>HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server
             know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using 
            appropriate MIME-type.</li>
            
            <li>HTTP is stateless, but not sessionless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same 
            connection. This immediately has the prospect of being problematic for users attempting to interact with certain pages coherently, 
            for example, using e-commerce shopping baskets.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="container">

        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like 
        message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Server</h3>
        <p>The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a
             MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possible entity-body content. </p>
